# pyCertLogo
OpenSSL config-file generator to embed pictures or audio sketches into X.509 digital certificates.
Implements X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) standards [RFC 3709](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3709) (“Logotypes in X.509 Certificates”) and [RFC 6170](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6170) (“Certificate Image”).
This may also be used for *electronic* certificates, pursuant to [Regulation (UE) №910/2014 “**eIDAS**”](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation) (currently being updated), used for electronic signatures (e-signing), seals (e-sealing), attestations of attribute, ledgers, website authentication and other types of electronic trust services.

Its main purpose is supporting the generation of OpenSSL configuration files allowing the embedding of logotypes (either images and audio, cfr. below) into X.509 public-key or attribute certificates, originally conforming to ITU-T X.509 Standard, cfr. [RFC 5280](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280).

Certificate logos may augment final applications and improve the overall *digital trust*, as they provide trusted visual representations of people, organizations, website and/or IT systems which digital certificates are bound to. The digital signature of a CA over such digital certificate also protects the embedded logos/logotypes, thus ensuring their integrity and authenticity together with the rest of the certified data (e.g. a public key or attribute). Specific implementation of certiticate logo/logotype/image include at least:
 * Compositing, on an electronically signed PDF document, of the scanned picture of the signatory's (natural person's) handwritten signature, derived from the e-signature certificate itself. When the e-signed document printed on paper or viewed on screen, the e-signature's visual representation ("PDF signature") still represents a trusted image of the signatory's handwritten signature.
 * Compositing, on an electronically sealed PDF document, of the logotypes of the organization, federation, products, and/or etc. that improve visual authentication of the document itself.
 * Extract from the identification/authentication certificate in a ID smartcard - or associated with any electronic identification means (eID), the ID owner's ICAO-compliant photo.
 * Display the logotype of a trusted website's organization directly from its TLS / web-authentication certificate (WAC), as soon as the website is visited. The web browser performing an off-page validation of the WAC and visually represents such validation's outcome together with the embedded logos (instead of displaying the WAC's `commonName` or other distinguished names of the WAC subject) provides an additional effective method to protect against spoofed, typosquatted, defaced websites.
 * Applications processing e-sealed non-PDF documents (e.g. XML, JSON/JWS messages, e.g. OAuth/SAML assertions or tokens) may extract pictures from their e-sealing certificates e-sealing, providing and using them to provide or augment GUI-driven visual representations of such documents or processes to the users. For example, an otherwise anonymous XML document icon may be augmented by adding seal(s) on the icon representing one or more logos taken from the electronic certificate associated to the doument's e-seal. Visual processing of a transaction (e.g. e-payment) on a website or other software may include the circuit's or the service provider's logoype by authoritatively extracting it from the e-sealing certificate. 

This Python script includes a service class to manipulate Object Identifiers (OIDs) and classes to prepare logos embedding within X.509 certificates. With this script the specific section of a OpenSSL configuration file is generated for the logos(s) to embed. When OpenSSL (or compatible appliations, e.g. [*`xca`*](https://hohnstaedt.de/xca/)) parses the certificate profile config-file, that should referenced from the profile's X509v3 extensions' section.

Currently supported file formats for certificate logos are GIF, JPEG, PNG, SVG(Z), PDF, as well as MP3 (meant to contain logotypes' audio description), although the script does currently only inspect SVG(Z) logotypes to perform mild validations: it is up to the user to ensure the files comply with the aforementioned RFCs' format-specific constrains.
